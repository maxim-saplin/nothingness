# Testing Standards

## Organization
We mirror the `lib/` directory structure within `test/` to ensure tests are easy to locate.

- `test/models/` -> Unit tests for data models.
- `test/services/` -> Unit tests for services (mock dependencies).
- `test/widgets/` -> Widget tests for reusable components.
- `test/screens/` -> Widget tests for full pages.
- `test/testing/` -> Unit tests for test harness helpers under `lib/testing/`.

We also use Flutter’s emulator/device integration tests:

- `integration_test/` -> End-to-end behavior tests on a real device/emulator.

## Requirement
- All new logic (models, services) must have unit tests.
- All new UI components (widgets, screens) must have widget tests.
- Behavior that depends on platform/device eventing (e.g. “natural track ended”, lifecycle, real navigation flows) should have **integration_test** coverage.
- **No Placeholders**: Do not commit empty test files or placeholder tests (e.g., `expect(true, isTrue)`). If a component cannot be tested yet, document the reason in the code or a tracking issue, but do not create a dummy test file.

## Integration tests (emulator/device)

Use `integration_test/` when validating **cross-widget behavior** or contracts that are hard to express in pure widget tests:

- Skip/advance behavior across tap/next/prev/end events
- “Inspectable” diagnostics flows and stable UI selectors

### Test-only entrypoint

When integration tests need deterministic behavior (no real audio files, no plugin-level playback), use a test-only entrypoint such as:

- `lib/main_test.dart`

This can wire:

- a fake transport
- controllable file-exists provider
- stable selectors (e.g. `ValueKey`s) for automation

## How to Add Tests
1. **Create File**: Create a test file in the corresponding `test/` subdirectory (e.g., `lib/models/foo.dart` -> `test/models/foo_test.dart`).
2. **Mocking**: Use `mockito` for external dependencies.
   - Add `@GenerateMocks([DependencyClass])` to your test entry point if needed.
   - Run `dart run build_runner build` to generate mocks.
3. **Widget Tests**: Use `testWidgets` and `pumpWidget`. Ensure you wrap widgets in `MaterialApp` if they depend on theme/navigation.

## How to Run Tests
- **All Tests**: `flutter test`
- **Specific File**: `flutter test test/path/to/file_test.dart`
- **Integration tests (single file)**: `flutter test -d <deviceId> integration_test/some_test.dart`
