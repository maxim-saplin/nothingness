# Creating and Managing Rules

This project uses Cursor Project Rules stored in `.cursor/rules/`.

## Format
All rules must be created as `.mdc` (Markdown with Content) files.

### Frontmatter
Each rule file must start with a YAML frontmatter block containing:
- `description`: A clear, concise description of what the rule does. Used by the agent to decide relevance.
- `globs`: A list of glob patterns (comma-separated if multiple) defining which files trigger this rule.
- `alwaysApply`: `true` or `false`. Set to `false` by default unless the rule is critical and global.

### Example
```markdown
---
description: Standards for writing new rules
globs: .cursor/rules/*.mdc
alwaysApply: false
---
# Rule Content
...
```

## Best Practices
1. **Focus**: Keep rules focused on a single topic (e.g., "Testing", "Styling").
2. **Actionable**: Provide concrete instructions and examples.
3. **Naming**: Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `testing-standards.mdc`).
4. **Scoping**: Use `globs` effectively to limit rules to relevant contexts (e.g., `test/**/*.dart` for testing rules).
