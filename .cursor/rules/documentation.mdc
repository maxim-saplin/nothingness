# Documentation Standards

## When to Document
-   **Architecture Changes**: Whenever a new major component (service, screen, complex widget) is added or refactored.
-   **Complex Logic**: Algorithms (like FFT processing or Auto-Scaling) require a design doc.
-   **Standards**: When establishing new team rules (testing, naming, etc.).

## Where to Document
-   All documentation lives in the `docs/` directory.
-   `docs/architecture/`: System design, data flow, component interaction.
-   `docs/standards/` (or root `.cursor/rules/` for agent rules): Coding standards.

## Format
-   **Markdown**: Use standard GFM.
-   **Mermaid**: Use Mermaid diagrams for all visual flows (graphs, sequences, class diagrams).
-   **Links**: Use relative links to other docs (e.g., `[Overview](architecture/overview.md)`).

## Style
Keep docs straightforward—no marketing fluff or filler:
- State what the component does and how to run it.
- Avoid buzzwords ("reporting surface", "purpose-built", etc.).
- Prefer short, direct sentences; skip padding and restatements.

## Agent Behavior
-   **Do not pollute context**: Do not read all docs into context unless specifically asked.
-   **Update Index**: Always update `docs/README.md` when adding a new file.
-   **Reference**: When explaining a complex topic to the user, reference the existing doc rather than re-explaining from scratch, unless asked for a summary.
