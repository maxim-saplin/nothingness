# Backlog — Closed

Items moved here when fixed. Append-only trail for regression context and
extraction-just-in-case. See [`backlog.md`](backlog.md) for open items and
the shared conventions.

Each closed entry preserves its original H2 (`## B-0NN (severity): title`)
and body, plus a `**Closed**: YYYY-MM-DD — summary` line at the bottom.

## Pre-existing closed items (ui-revamp arc, 2026-05-22 and earlier)

`B-001` through `B-006` and `B-009` were closed during the `ui-revamp` arc
and merged into `main` as commit `4fb5d27` (v3.0.0+40). Their detailed
entries lived in the arc's `bugs.md`, which was deleted at merge time. The
short tags below are sufficient for "have we seen this before?" lookups; if
you need the full original write-up, `git show 4fb5d27~1:bugs.md` (or walk
the `ui-revamp` branch's history) recovers it.

- **B-001** — smart-roots showed the full filesystem.
- **B-002** — gesture-nav overlapped chrome at the bottom edge.
- **B-003** — 54 px immersive transition overflow stripe.
- **B-004** — settings entry-point `·` glyph was too small to hit.
- **B-005** — launch hint was once-only (now shows on every cold launch
  and fades after 3 s).
- **B-006** — background-mode hijacked the screen on first run.
- **B-009** — search scope was limited to `currentPath` instead of the
  whole library.

**Closed**: 2026-05-22 — shipped together in merge `4fb5d27`.

## B-007 (minor): Android Back exits Void silently — verify

**Symptom** (historical): Pressing Android Back from `VoidScreen` exited the
app silently. Audio kept playing but UI state was lost.

**Status**: Plausibly already fixed — `PopScope` is wired at
`lib/screens/void_screen.dart:302` with `_onPopInvoked` at line 454
that collapses the swipe-up browser, exits search, then walks the
library tree up before letting the OS pop. **Needs an explicit live
verification** before closing: on the emulator, press Back from various
chrome states and confirm the order above holds.

**Area**: chrome / navigation

**Closed**: 2026-05-24 — verified on emulator-5554, PopScope order holds across all five chrome states (root → background; subfolder → folder up; expanded swipe-up browser → collapse; search mode → exits search after the standard IME-dismiss tap; settings sheet → closes via Navigator pop).

## B-010 (major): Rapid `setSetting(themeVariant)` saturates the VM service

**Symptom**: Driving `ext.nothingness.setSetting name=themeVariant ...`
at >15 calls/second over the VM service stops the isolate responding.

**Likely cause**: VM-service RPC saturation, not user-facing logic. The
in-tree widget test `test/p6_adversarial_test.dart` exercises the same
code path at the same cadence in-process and passes.

**Desired**: Either rate-limit the extension handler, or document that the
test agent must throttle. No user-facing fix needed if the diagnosis
holds — but if a user-driven path can reach the same cadence (e.g. a
settings cycle held down with hardware key repeat), we need a real fix.

**Area**: testing / agent-service

**Closed**: 2026-05-24 — diagnosis confirmed on emulator-5554: each `setSetting` RPC costs ~140 ms steady-state (awaits `SharedPreferences.setString`), so sustained send rates above ~7/s back up the response queue. At >500/s pipelined the queue grows beyond reasonable drain timeouts, matching the original "stops responding" symptom; isolate recovers once drained. No user-driven path can reach this cadence: the only write paths are `agent_service._setSetting` and `VoidSettingsSheet._cycleVariant` (tap-only, no hardware-key repeat or timer). Documented the cadence ceiling and recovery in `.claude/skills/agent-emulator-debugging/SKILL.md`; recommended ≤5/s for `setSetting`-style calls, with `test/p6_adversarial_test.dart` as the in-process equivalent for higher cadences.

## B-019 (minor): Crumb and browser rows truncate the tail

**Symptom**: When text doesn't fit the row width, Flutter's default
`TextOverflow.ellipsis` clips the **end**. For the crumb this hides the
current folder name; for browser rows this hides the rest of the song
title. Both are the more informative end.

**Repro**: `drive.py call ext.nothingness.setSetting name=uiScale value=2.5`
→ navigate to `/storage/emulated/0/Music/Russian Rock`. Screenshot
`.tmp/agent_shots/crumb_scaled.png` shows:
- Crumb: `/storage/emulated…` — current folder gone.
- Browser rows: `Ария - Бесп…`, `Кино - Груп…` — song titles
  truncated to the artist + the start of the title.

**Desired**: Adopt a consistent "keep the meaningful tail" policy across
the chrome:
- Crumb: head-truncate, `…/Music/Russian Rock`.
- Browser file rows: head-truncate, `…бесп ангел`. (Folder rows are
  usually short enough not to matter, but the same rule should apply
  for safety.)
- Implement once as a small `MidEllipsis` widget that takes a
  `keepEnd` length hint, used by both call sites.

**Notes**:
- Crumb: `lib/screens/void_screen.dart:563-572`.
- Browser file rows: `lib/widgets/void_browser.dart:553-562, 469-487`
  (search result rows have a similar issue at lines 458-487).
- Watch RTL: the same trick that keeps the tail in LTR will keep the
  head in RTL, which is what RTL users actually want — so the
  implementation should respect ambient `TextDirection`.

**Area**: chrome / crumb / browser

**Closed**: 2026-05-24 — head-truncating widget added; wired into crumb + browser file rows + search result rows.

## B-016 (minor): Settings sheet has no at-a-glance status

**Symptom**: Opening settings drops the user straight into the MODE group.
No queue size, no shuffle state — both require leaving settings to check.

**Repro**: Screenshot `.tmp/agent_shots/settings_top.png` — header reads
`< settings`, then MODE → operating mode. Nothing surfaces queue length
or shuffle.

**Desired**: A non-scrolling status strip above the MODE group:
- queue size (e.g. `queue · 47 tracks`)
- shuffle toggle (live; toggling here calls
  `AudioPlayerProvider.shuffleQueue` / `disableShuffle`)

**Notes**: Header lives at `lib/widgets/void_settings_sheet.dart:858-891`.
Insert the new row between `_header` and the first `_groupHeader`. Use
`_toggleRow` for shuffle to match existing visual language. There is no
shuffle row anywhere else in settings today — confirmed by reading the
full `_buildGroups` method.

**Area**: settings

**Closed**: 2026-05-24 — status strip (queue size + shuffle toggle) added above MODE group in void settings sheet.
