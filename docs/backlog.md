# Backlog

Single-file issue tracker for in-flight UX/bug work on `main`. Continues the
`B-NNN` numbering from the closed `ui-revamp` arc (last id was B-010).

## Conventions

- One H2 per issue: `## B-0NN (severity): title` — severity is `minor` /
  `major` / `blocker`.
- Body uses these fields (omit any that don't apply):
  - **Symptom** — what the user observes.
  - **Repro** — exact sequence (driver commands welcome) plus the runtime
    evidence we collected (numbers, screenshots, logcat snips).
  - **Desired** — what we want it to do.
  - **Notes** — code pointers (`path/to/file.dart:line`), constraints,
    cross-refs (`see B-0NN`).
  - **Area** — short tag (`chrome`, `search`, `transport`, `permissions`,
    `browser`, `heroes`, `settings`).
- When an item is fixed, **move the entry to `backlog_done.md`** and append
  a `**Closed**: YYYY-MM-DD — one-line summary of the resolution (commit
  hash if useful)` line at the bottom of the moved entry. Keep the trail —
  it's cheap to read and pays off when a regression looks familiar.
- New ids are assigned monotonically across both files. Don't reuse closed
  ids; check `backlog_done.md` too when picking the next id.
